            Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, which was then part of British India. He received his early education in Karachi and Bombay and later went to London to study law at Lincoln’s Inn. He was a brilliant student and a sharp debater, which helped him lay the foundation for a strong political career in the years to come.More than seven decades have passed since Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah led the historic movement for Pakistan's creation, securing a homeland for the Muslims of the Subcontinent through his extraordinary vision, determination, and leadership. His vision was not simply about carving out a piece of land; it was about creating a state embodying the values of justice, equality, rule of law, and inclusivity. Quaid-e-Azam's dream was for Pakistan to become a beacon of hope and progress for its citizens, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or social background. He envisioned a nation where Muslims could practice their faith freely, without fear of persecution, but also where people of other religions could live peacefully and equally as citizens of the state.
